MATLAB is required for use of the app (available for Windows/Mac/Linux).

To run the app, simply open the .mlapp file in MATLAB and run.

There may be incompatabilities with the database because it was designed to run with the database I have on my computer.

App instructions:
1. Enter a patient name and hit ENTER
2. Click on the empty checkboxes to direct the app to folders containing CT and MR images
3. Click the now active load patient button
4. View CT/MR images if desired
5. Select desired registration algorithm from the dropdown menu and begin registration
6. View registration results in the bottom-right table
7. Click the Export button at the top of the app to export the registration results to .csv
8. Exit by closing the app or clicking the Exit button
